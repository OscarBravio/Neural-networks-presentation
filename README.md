# Neural-networks-presentation

Neural networks presentation consists of basic teoretical knowledge about neural networks like multi-layer perceptron
and autoencoders with descriptions of their hyperparameters and empirical examples of how changes of hyperparameters values
influence network's results. Additionally, results are compared with other ML methods like logistic regression, decision tress, 
random forests or PCA.

There are two files in the repository:

1) jupyter notebook generates dataset and all the computations

2) presenation in HTML generated from file (1)

##### Note! Presentation contains LaTex equations so it may require to have installed MathJax or other Latex browser tool, 
to make them work properly.
